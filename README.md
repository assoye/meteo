Welcome to soundWeather !

In order create a weather website, I decided to use three different APIs to make a complete website for it 
to be more intuitive and enjoyable for the users

#My APIs : 
- OpenWeatherMap: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
- Yahoo : https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/
- Deezer : https://developers.deezer.com/api/track

#Each of the API has been used to do a different property of the website. 
- OpenWeatherMap has been used to recover the current weather and the next hours (on 12 hours)
- Yahoo has been used to recover the forecast weather (6 days to come)
- Deezer has been used to recover the identifier of a music. I use the API to add music to my player that changes with the weather

#soundMeteo is structured with 3 pages : 
- The Homepage is a form or the user enter the city of his choice
- The currentWeather page regroup the actual weather with a changing design, changing temperature, musics... There is also the weather of the next hours 
- The previsions page shows us the weather forecast for the next 6 days of the selected city

#My files : 
- index.php 
- currentWeather.php
- include.php = contains most of the switchs and functions
- style.css = all the css and the responsive
- main.js = javascript code for the player

#Problem : 
I think there is a problem of display between the different screens...

Enjoy the weather !
